## About
My submission for Master the Mainframe 2020 Grand Challenge.

## Title
Dashy-ZOAU

## Notes
Tired of seeing the same old terminal everyday when you login to the USS? Presenting Dashy-ZOAU - a handy tool to gather and display information about the jobs that ran in the mainframe. It comes with a gorgeous login dashboard banner and Job-Stat, a CLI to filter and output various job details to a file or to a dataset - its magic made possible by ZOAU. Top it all up with vibrant colors to spice up your terminal and be greeted by the cow we are most familiar with.

## Directions
Copy the ‘Dashy-ZOAU’ folder from my USS home directory in /z/z07216. Next, cd into the folder to run the ‘setup.sh’ file, and configure if you would like to have the banner set-up automatically. After initial installation and setup, you may wish to customize the settings and colors using the ‘settings.py’ file. Lastly, run `jobStat.py --help` to get started. 

The colors displayed on your screen should be similar to the screenshot shown in the flyer and there are also no job owner filters for the login dashboard banner by default. These are customizable through `settings.py`.

For more information, you may refer to the comments within the individual files for some troubleshooting and guiding instructions. Additionally, you may wish to visit https://github.com/wonyk/Dashy-ZOAU#setup for detailed setup commands to achieve the abovementioned steps.

Enjoy using Dashy-ZOAU!
